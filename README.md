# FCC Back end - API Project - URL Shortener

API project required for the Back End Development Certification of freeCodeCamp

**User Stories:**
* I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
* If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
* When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

**Example Usage:**
* https://rlisboars-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/https://www.google.com will return a JSON with the original url and the shortened url. Use the shortened url to be redirected to the original url.
